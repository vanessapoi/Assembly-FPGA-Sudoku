# Sudoku Game

To start, a random sudoku game is displayed with a 9x9 grid and 4 hearts on the VGA.
Current grid position is highlighted with a green outline. The user can use switches 1-9 to insert
numbers in the squares and switch 0 to clear the square. The selected switchâ€™s corresponding
LED will light up and the selected number will be shown on the 7-segment display. The keys can
be used to move around the grid (left, up, down, right). Alternatively, the user can use the
keyboard numbers 1-9 to enter numbers (also shown on the HEX) and the arrow keys to move
around. Some of the basic rules of sudoku that are upheld include: the user is not permitted to
input a number where the original numbers are, correct answers are green, incorrect answers are
red and will result in a lost heart. If the user wins or loses (by making 4 mistakes) the
corresponding sound effect will play and the game will end.
